## Features

- Browse compatible public repositories without signing in, and access authorized private repositories after signing in.
- Create, add, and manage GitHub-NetDisk repositories from the client.
- Upload, download, rename, and delete files; create and recursively download folders.
- Store file contents in a dedicated GitHub Release while keeping only a lightweight `netdisk.json` index in the Git repository.
- Automatically split files larger than 1.9 GiB into ordered Release assets and verify completed downloads with SHA-256.
- Switch repository branches and quickly reopen recently used repositories.
- Use light or dark themes, HiDPI, and Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, or English.

## Quick start

Python 3.8–3.11 is recommended.

1. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install .
```

To enable accelerated downloads with aria2, install `aria2c` and make sure it is available in the `tools` folder or on `PATH`. The client connects to an existing local aria2 RPC service or automatically starts a private local service for the application. It falls back to the built-in downloader when aria2c is unavailable.

2. Start GitHub NetDisk:

```shell
python GitHub-NetDisk.py
```

On first launch, connecting an account through GitHub App Device Flow is recommended. You can also continue without signing in and use read-only mode. Personal Access Token is available only as an advanced compatibility option, and credentials are stored in the operating-system credential vault.

## Application links

Installed builds register the `github-netdisk://` protocol and support the following formats:

```text
github-netdisk://new-task/download/repo/?uri=owner/repo@branch/path/to/file&filename=file.bin
github-netdisk://new-task/upload/url/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fupload&filename=/local/file.bin
github-netdisk://browse-repo/?repo=owner/repo&branch=main
```

Opening a new-task link first displays a task dialog populated with the corresponding values and waits for user confirmation.

## Tests

```shell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
```

Live GitHub integration tests are skipped by default and can be explicitly enabled with an environment variable:

```shell
GITHUB_NETDISK_INTEGRATION=1 pytest -q test/test_netdisk.py
```

## Deployment

1. Run the deployment script:

```shell
python -m pip install -e ".[build]"
python deploy.py
```

2. If the `aria2c` executable is stored in the `tools` folder, copy the `tools` folder into the packaged application:
   - Windows/Linux: copy it to the packaged application's `tools` directory.
   - macOS: copy it to `dist/GitHub-NetDisk.app/Contents/MacOS/tools`.
